# RealBot 🤖✨

**RealBot** is a next-generation, multi-purpose Discord bot powered by Google's Gemini family of models. It goes beyond simple commands, operating as an autonomous agent capable of reasoning, using tools, and even rewriting its own code to evolve new capabilities on the fly.

> 🚀 **New: Easy Docker Setup!** Get started in seconds with `docker-compose up -d`. See the [Docker Installation section](#installation-docker---recommended) below.

## Core Features

### 🧠 Agent & AI

*   **`!ask` - The Agentic Core**: A powerful, multi-tool agent that can search Discord, generate various media (images, video, music, sound effects), browse the web, and more. It can understand complex, multi-step requests and use its tools to accomplish them.
*   **`!research` - Deep Research Agent**: Performs multi-step research on a given topic, streaming its progress and providing a final report.
*   **`!code` - OpenCode AI Interface**: Provides a conversational interface to a powerful, separate coding AI service, allowing for natural language-based coding assistance.
*   **`/chatty` - Passive Chatting**: Can be configured to listen to a channel and chime in on conversations, with an awareness of the emotional tone and user relationships.
*   **`/persona` - Persona Management**: The bot's personality can be customized and changed on the fly, either by selecting from a list of pre-defined personas or by creating a new one through an interactive interview.

### 🧬 Code Generation & Self-Evolution

*   **`/evolve` - Dynamic Code Generation**: The bot can write and manage its own code. Give it a natural language description, and it will generate a new Discord.py cog to add the requested functionality.
*   **`/plugin` - Plugin Management**: A full suite of commands to manage the cogs generated by `/evolve`, including loading, unloading, reloading, deleting, and viewing the source code.

### 🛠️ Administration & Moderation

*   **`!admin` - Live Code Modification**: Admins can modify the bot's code directly with a command, which then restarts the bot to apply the changes.
*   **`/forcenick` - Nickname Enforcement**: Force a user to have a specific nickname.
*   **`!protect` - Voice Mute Protection**: An administrator-only command to automatically un-mute a user if they are server-muted in a voice channel.
*   **Verification System**: A comprehensive system for managing new user verification, including a voice channel queue and overflow system.
*   **`/serveractivity` - Server Analytics**: An owner-only command that generates a report on the most active channels in each server the bot is in.

### 🎉 Fun & Utility

*   **`/chaos` & `/allchaos` - Chaos Mode**: A fun moderation tool that uses AI to "troll" specific users or entire channels by rewriting their messages into "crazier, creepier, stalkier, unhinged" versions.
*   **`!roast @user`**: Scrapes a user's recent message history and uses Gemini to generate a personalized roast.
*   **`!info` - System Information**: Displays a comprehensive embed with detailed bot and system statistics.
*   **`!cu` - Computer Control**: The owner can use the bot to control a headless browser, performing tasks like navigating websites and taking screenshots.

### 🎨 Media Generation

*   **Image Generation (`!nano2`, `!ask`)**: Generates images from text prompts or other images. The `!nano2` command has its own user access control system.
*   **Video Generation (`!ask`)**: Creates AI videos using Google's Veo model.
*   **Music Generation (`!ask`)**: Composes full songs (lyrics + audio) or instrumentals using Suno AI.
*   **Sound Effect Generation (`!ask`)**: Creates custom sound effects using ElevenLabs.
*   **Image Editing (`!ask`)**: Edits existing images with natural language instructions, including background removal and upscaling.
